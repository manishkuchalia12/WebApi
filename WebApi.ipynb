    "Q1. What is an API? Give an example, where an API is used in real life.\n",
    "Ans:-API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and tools that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. It defines the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information. \n",
    "Example: Weather API\n",
    "Real-Life Use Case: Weather applications on smartphones often use weather APIs to fetch current conditions, forecasts, and other relevant data. For instance, a weather app might use a third-party weather API to provide accurate and up-to-date information to users."

    "Q2. Give advantages and disadvantages of using API.\n",
    "Ans:- Advantages\n",
    "1.APIs enable different software systems to communicate and work together, promoting interoperability.\n",
    "2. APIs allow software to be developed in a modular fashion. Developers can focus on specific functionalities, and changes to one module do not necessarily impact others.\n",
    "3.APIs facilitate faster development by providing pre-built functionalities. Developers can leverage existing APIs to avoid reinventing the wheel, saving time and effort.\n",
    "Disadvantages\n",
    "1. Applications relying on external APIs are dependent on the stability and availability of those services.\n",
    "2. APIs may pose security risks if not properly secured. Unauthorized access, data breaches, and other vulnerabilities can occur if security measures are not adequately implemented.\n",
    "3. Developers using third-party APIs have limited control over changes and updates made by the API provider. Modifications to the API may affect the functionality of dependent applications."
